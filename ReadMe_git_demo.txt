This is a demo readme text for git_demo repository which was created using git UI online through browser. Post that the repository was cloned and created on PC using the following steps:
pre-requisites: install github desktop on PC and use git bash / command line to perform following 

step 1: navigate through 'cd <path>' command to navigate to the location in the PC where you want to clone the remote repository. 
step 2: clone the remote repository into desktop using $git clone <URL>
where <URL> is the link of the repository created on Github account.

step 3: To see the name of master branch, type the below command:
$git remote

step 4: to see the name of all the aliases of the master branch cloned in local repository with same name of the remote repository: 
$git remote -v

This way you have created a local repository cloning the remote one, and any changes made to the local will be pushed to remote, steps of which will be explained in ReadMe_git_demo_1.txt
